# Audubon #

A system to intelligently synchronize your Twitter timeline with your own website.

## Principles ##

- Never copy content that isn't the user's
- Use embedded tweets (OEmbed) to provide context

## Installation ##

1. Don't. This isn't anywhere close to done.
2. Seriously, don't.
3. Fine.
4. Copy `config-blank.php` to `config.php` and fill out the appropriate info
5. Create a MySQL database and user
6. Load `schema.sql` into said database
7. um...
8. See, this is where you'd actually do something.
9. I guess load `import.php` in a web browser?
10. Then manually browse your database and gaze at your tweets?
